# Dungeon-Java-Game

## About
This project was a Java-based dungeon game that was created for a pretend client using scrum development. The game was based on a trapped miner that is trying to escape with the help of a rock creature. He must fight off other rock creatures as he mines through the app. The player is directed through the game with blocks that cannot be destroyed but most of the map can be destroyed. This feature allows for different experiences with each run through the game. As the player mines, they can collect precious material to upgrade their armour. The project was done within a team with the original repo here: [original repo][repo].

## Technologies
Java, LibgDX

## What I Learned
This project was completed within a team using a Scrum process with pretend client being a lecturer from the university. This provided a more realistic experience of Scrum. The biggest skill I learned was team management of the project and organising what needs doing in the time given.
